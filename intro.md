# Welcome

This is a curated set of notes that I think sit well together for me to reference. I like [tiddlywiki](https://wiki.alexjj.com) for everything but it's nice having an ordered notebook to look in.

Here's everything so far:

```{tableofcontents}
```

### Temp list of things I might add

* computer software configuration
* books I've read
* books I want to read
* film development
* films I've used and thoughts
* lists of stuff I have
* monthly write ups
* annual/monthly targets
* Quotes and other snippets

hmm...starting to sound just like a wiki but in a notebook form ðŸ˜… Maybe I should actually write some of them vs. doing none of them.
